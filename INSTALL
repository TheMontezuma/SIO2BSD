INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. su to root

2. cd to the directory where the sio2bsd archive has been unpacked to

3. gmake install

The Makefile is prepared for FreeBSD and Linux, and the resulting binary 
will be copied to /usr/local/bin. You may want to edit some defaults in 
the Makefile.

As of version 1.10 you may also try to compile the program under Cygwin. 
In this case it is enough to unpack the program, go to the directory where 
it was unpacked to, and do 'make'. Tested with Cygwin 1.7.7.
